# micropython-gy521
Micropython library to interface with GY521 (Invensense MPU-6050 6-axis accel+gyro)

## Getting Started notes:
I needed to conda install virtualenv and cookiecutter in the root Conda env.
Probably useful in general, so they can be global.

## Plan:
Make it as pythonic as possible
Make it as async as possible
Make it as light as possible

## Sources:
(https://github.com/larsks/py-mpu6050 for the idea.  No code reused.)

Do I need to run with native code and the Invensense EmbeddedMotionDrive?
